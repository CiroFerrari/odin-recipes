            <li>In a large bowl, whip the egg whites on high speed until foamy. Continue to whip on high speed while adding salt, cream of tartar, vanilla and almond extract.

            <li>Pour batter into a 10-inch tube pan. Sprinkle top with chopped almonds. Bake at 375 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 40 minutes, or until top of cake bounces back when lightly tapped. Remove from oven, invert pan, and allow to cool in the pan.
